# 第二章 第9节：定时图

这只是个提案，主题和内容可能改变  

非常欢迎您参与这个新特性的讨论。您的反馈、创意和建议可以帮助我们找寻适合的解决方案。  

## 声明参与者

使用 `concise` or `robust` 关键字声明参与者, 选择哪个取决于所需的显示样式。    

通过 `@` 标注, 和 `is` 动词定义状态.  

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Web 浏览器" as WB
concise "Web 用户" as WU

@0
WU is 空闲
WB is 空闲

@100
WU is 等待中
WB is 处理中

@300
WB is 等待中
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Web 浏览器" as WB
concise "Web 用户" as WU

@0
WU is 空闲
WB is 空闲

@100
WU is 等待中
WB is 处理中

@300
WB is 等待中
@enduml
```

## Binary and Clock

It's also possible to have binary and clock signal, using the following keywords:  

- `binary`
- `clock`

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

clock clk with period 1
binary "Enable" as EN

@0
EN is low

@5
EN is high

@10
EN is low
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

clock clk with period 1
binary "Enable" as EN

@0
EN is low

@5
EN is high

@10
EN is low
@enduml
```

## 增加消息

使用下述的语法增加对消息的描述。

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Web 浏览器" as WB
concise "Web 用户" as WU

@0
WU is 空闲
WB is 空闲

@100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is 等待中
WB is 处理中

@300
WB is 等待中
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Web 浏览器" as WB
concise "Web 用户" as WU

@0
WU is 空闲
WB is 空闲

@100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is 等待中
WB is 处理中

@300
WB is 等待中
@enduml
```

## 相对时间

It is possible to use relative time with `@`.

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "DNS Resolver" as DNS
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle
DNS is Idle

@+100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is Waiting
WB is Processing

@+200
WB is Waiting
WB -> DNS@+50 : Resolve URL

@+100
DNS is Processing

@+300
DNS is Idle
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "DNS Resolver" as DNS
robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is Idle
WB is Idle
DNS is Idle

@+100
WU -> WB : URL
WU is Waiting
WB is Processing

@+200
WB is Waiting
WB -> DNS@+50 : Resolve URL

@+100
DNS is Processing

@+300
DNS is Idle
@enduml
```

## Anchor Points

Instead of using absolute or relative time on an absolute time you can define a time as an anchor point by using the as keyword and starting the name with a :.

@XX as :<anchor point name>

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

clock clk with period 1
binary "enable" as EN
concise "dataBus" as db

@0 as :start
@5 as :en_high 
@10 as :en_low


@:start
EN is low
db is "0x0000"

@:en_high
EN is high

@:en_low
EN is low

@:en_high-2
db is "0xf23a"

@:en_high+6
db is "0x0000"
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

clock clk with period 1
binary "enable" as EN
concise "dataBus" as db

@0 as :start
@5 as :en_high 
@10 as :en_low


@:start
EN is low
db is "0x0000"

@:en_high
EN is high

@:en_low
EN is low

@:en_high-2
db is "0xf23a"

@:en_high+6
db is "0x0000"
@enduml
```

## Participant oriented

Rather than declare the diagram in chronological order, you can define it by participant.

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Proc.
+100 is Waiting

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Proc.
+100 is Waiting

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

## Setting scale

You can also set a specific scale.

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

concise "Web User" as WU
scale 100 as 50 pixels

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

concise "Web User" as WU
scale 100 as 50 pixels

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

## Initial state

You can also define an inital state.

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

WB is Initializing
WU is Absent

@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Processing
+100 is Waiting

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Web Browser" as WB
concise "Web User" as WU

WB is Initializing
WU is Absent

@WB
0 is idle
+200 is Processing
+100 is Waiting

@WU
0 is Waiting
+500 is ok
@enduml
```

## Intricated state

A signal could be in some undefined state.

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Signal1" as S1
robust "Signal2" as S2
S1 has 0,1,2,hello
S2 has 0,1,2
@0
S1 is 0
S2 is 0
@100
S1 is {0,1} #SlateGrey
S2 is {0,1}
@200
S1 is 1
S2 is 0
@300
S1 is hello
S2 is {0,2}
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

robust "Signal1" as S1
robust "Signal2" as S2
S1 has 0,1,2,hello
S2 has 0,1,2
@0
S1 is 0
S2 is 0
@100
S1 is {0,1} #SlateGrey
S2 is {0,1}
@200
S1 is 1
S2 is 0
@300
S1 is hello
S2 is {0,2}
@enduml
```

## Hidden state

It is also possible to hide some state.

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is {-}

@100
WU is A1

@200
WU is {-}

@300
WU is {hidden}

@400
WU is A3

@500
WU is {-}
@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

concise "Web User" as WU

@0
WU is {-}

@100
WU is A1

@200
WU is {-}

@300
WU is {hidden}

@400
WU is A3

@500
WU is {-}
@enduml
```

## Hide time axis

It is possible to hide time axis.

```markdown
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

concise "Web User" as WU

WU is Absent

@WU
0 is Waiting

@enduml
```

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam defaultFontName "Source Han Sans SC Light"

hide time-axis
concise "Web User" as WU
